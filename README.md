# Card Collector Mobile App
A personal project created in React Native
## What Does It Do?
This App was created to help Magic the Gathering players organize their cards in a filing system
## What Are We Using?
- Scryfall API is used to retrieve all card data so all cards are up to date and have all of the relevant data
- Node.js and Express are used to contact the MongoDB database which holds all relevant information
